#### Installing the tools

In the development of S.M.D, a few VS Code extensions are used, namely:

- Prettier formatter (esbenp.prettier-vscode)

- Community Material Theme Darker High Contrast (I love this theme :grin:)

You need to install Prettier code formatter or install prettier as a Node JS dependency. I use the VS Code Extension, it's much more easier for me. Prettier is the default code formatter.
