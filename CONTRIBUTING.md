- Run npm install to install all the project dependencies

#### Building the application

- Run `npm run pack:win32` to build for Windows x32

- Run `npm run pack:win64` to build for Windows x64

- Run `npm run build` to build for all supported platforms

#### Installing the tools

There are a few VS Code extensions used in the development of S.M.D namely:

- Prettier formatter (esbenp.prettier-vscode)

- Community Material Theme Darker High Contrast (I love this theme :grin:)

You need to install Prettier code formatter or install prettier as a Node JS dependency. I use the VS Code Extension, it's much more easier for me. Prettier is the default code formatter.
