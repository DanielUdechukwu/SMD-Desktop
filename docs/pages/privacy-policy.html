        <p>11. <b>Your Data Protection Rights under the California Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA)</b></p>

        <p>
          CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy
          policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and
          conceivable the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California
          consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and
          those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy.
        </p>

        <p>According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:</p>

        <p>
          0.1. our Privacy Policy link includes the word “Privacy”, and can easily be found on the home page of our website;
        </p>

        <p>0.2. users will be notified of any privacy policy changes on our Privacy Policy Page;</p>

        <p>0.3. users are able to change their personal information by emailing us at <b>smddesktop@gmail.com</b>.</p>

        <p>Our Policy on “Do Not Track” Signals:</p>

        <p>
          We honor Do Not Track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track browser
          mechanism is in place. Do Not Track is a preference you can set in your web browser to inform websites that you do
          not want to be tracked.
        </p>

        <p>You can enable or disable Do Not Track by visiting the Preferences or Settings page of your web browser.</p>

        <p>12. <b>Your Data Protection Rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</b></p>

        <p>
          If you are a California resident, you are entitled to learn what data we collect about you, ask to delete your data
          and not to sell (share) it. To exercise your data protection rights, you can make certain requests and ask us:
        </p>

        <p><b>0.1. What personal information we have about you. If you make this request, we will return to you:</b></p>

        <p>0.0.1. The categories of personal information we have collected about you.</p>

        <p>
          0.0.6. A list of categories of personal information that we have sold, along with the category of any other company
          we sold it to. If we have not sold your personal information, we will inform you of that fact.
        </p>

        <p>
          0.0.7. A list of categories of personal information that we have disclosed for a business purpose, along with the
          category of any other company we shared it with.
        </p>

        <p>
          Please note, you are entitled to ask us to provide you with this information up to two times in a rolling
          twelve-month period. When you make this request, the information provided may be limited to the personal
          information we collected about you in the previous 12 months.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b
            >0.2. To delete your personal information. If you make this request, we will delete the personal information we
            hold about you as of the date of your request from our records and direct any service providers to do the same.

            your personal information, you may not be able to use certain functions that require your personal information to
            operate.
          </b>
        </p>

        <p>
          <b
            >0.3. To stop selling your personal information. We don’t sell or rent your personal information to any third
            parties for any purpose. We do not sell your personal information for monetary consideration. However, under some
            circumstances, a transfer of personal information to a third party, or within our family of companies, without
            monetary consideration may be considered a “sale” under California law.You are the only owner of your Personal
            Data and can request disclosure or deletion at any time.
          </b>
        </p>

        <p>If you submit a request to stop selling your personal information, we will stop making such transfers.</p>

        <p>
          Please note, if you ask us to delete or stop selling your data, it may impact your experience with us, and you may
          not be able to participate in certain programs or membership services which require the usage of your personal
          information to function. But in no circumstances, we will discriminate against you for exercising your rights.
        </p>

        <p>
          To exercise your California data protection rights described above, please send your request(s) by email:
