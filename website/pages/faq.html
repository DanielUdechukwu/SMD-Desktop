            S.M.D fetches data from spotify, hence the need to register a Spotify app in which S.M.D would use. S.M.D is an
            open-source application, so you actually need to create your own keys. <br />

            No, it's not, at least for now! It was added there in-case something changes and breaks the app, hence needing an

            love. For now, there are some bugs we know of and we are currently fixing, for now, you'll have to bear with us

            <h1>Bug #3: On first time download, downloading more than one track is impossible</h1>

            <h2>Detailed Description</h2>

            <p>
              Users are unable to download more than one track at once on first time downloads. On first time download, a
              dialog is displayed, indicating that some binaries are downloading in the background.
            </p>

            <h2>Steps to Reproduce:</h2>

            <ul>
              <li><span></span>Finish authentication with Spotify</li>

            <h2>Expected Behavior</h2>
            <p>After downloading the binaries, download only two tracks at a time, re-scheduling the rest for later.</p>

            <h2>Actual Behavior</h2>
            <p>
              One tracks gets downloaded and the rest never gets downloaded. Sometimes, two downloads, leaving the rest
              behind

            <h2>Workaround</h2>
            <p>
              User should download only one track immediately after installing the application, to process downloading
              binaries correctly, before then proceeding to download multiple tracks.

            <h2>Detailed Description</h2>

            <p>
              Users are unable to download more than 2 tracks simultaneously after binaries have been downloaded. Users
              should consider downloading not more than 2 tracks at once.

            <h2>Steps to Reproduce:</h2>

            <ul>

            <h2>Workaround</h2>
            <p>
              User should download only one track immediately after installing the application, to process downloading
              binaries correctly, before then proceeding to download at most w tracks only, simultaneously.

            <h1>Bug #5: Pending downloads remains in pending state, even after exiting application</h1>

            <h2>Detailed Description</h2>

            <p>
              When user exits the application, the pending downloads are never cleared, because that scenario has not been
              handled yet. So when user returns to the app, the downloads are still in pending state.
            </p>

            <h2>Steps to Reproduce:</h2>

            <ul>
              <li><span></span>Finish authentication with Spotify</li>
              <li><span></span>Navigate to the main screen</li>
              <li><span></span>Perform download using any of the normal methods; Search and Paste URL.</li>
              <li><span></span>Exit application while downloads are pending and return to the application.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Expected Behavior</h2>
            <p>
              Confirm if user wants to exit application and remove all pending downloads and maybe provide a way to still
              download that same track again without searching for that same track.
            </p>

            <h2>Actual Behavior</h2>
            <p>Pending downloads remain in an indeterminate state.</p>

            <h2>Workaround</h2>
            <p>Wait for all pending downloads to complete.</p>
